## Info
With the push of a button this app scrapes the frontpage of reddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/all/) and lists the threads on the page. Each populated entry lists the title of the thread and a link to the thread. The user can save articles to their saved list by pressing the "Add to Saved Articles" button. The user can also view their saved articles and make notes on them.
